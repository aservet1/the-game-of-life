This is really cool code a classmate of mine (Jordan) had on a forest
fire simulation project. He went way above expectations and made a really
cool trippy fractal simulation by having the trees grow back and get
burned over and over again.

Original code is probably saved somewhere else, I'm just working off of
that code and playing around with it. The forest fire simulation is a
cellular automaton simulation just like the game of life, so using this
as an example of doing it in the Java GUI, and looing through the code
he wrote to see what he did to make it so cool.
