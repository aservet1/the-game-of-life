# the-game-of-life
core C++ game of life tool that im designing to be useful by any program, as the core C++ simply takes a starting file and writes the output of so many steps of the game of life, given some parameters (right now the only special parameter, other than a flip book play by play of the process, is a spontaneous generation rate)
